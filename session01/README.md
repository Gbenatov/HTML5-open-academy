The goal of this session is to introduce the concept of Markup languages in the context of the World Wide Web.

Our hands-on learning task will include creating and editing a simple HTML file that will allow learners to get a feel
for writing markup using various tags.

## Learning materials

In this folder you can find an HTML file named `markup.html` that contains a simple markup example that we will write together during the session.
